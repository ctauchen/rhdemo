I [forked the GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/ctauchen/opendatahub.io) for the Open Data Hub doc set and [made some changes](https://gitlab.com/ctauchen/opendatahub.io/-/commit/bdffa92b309a8757f15d5ba5d38d953de2f138d0).

To do this, I had to:

* fork a repo in GitLab
* clone my fork into a local repo
* create a branch (`copyedits`)
* stage, commit, and push changes to origin
* make a pull request
* merge `copyedits` to `master`
