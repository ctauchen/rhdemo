Here I've built a simple static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages. It's nothing much to look at, but you'll see that I understand the basics of the [docs-as-code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) approach to technical documentation.

Take a look at the [repo](https://github.com/ctauchen/rhdemo) and its [commit history](https://github.com/ctauchen/rhdemo/commits/gh-pages) to see what I got up to.
